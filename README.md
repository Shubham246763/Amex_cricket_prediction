# Amex Match Prediction

This repository contains Python scripts and a Jupyter notebook for preprocessing and analyzing cricket match data related to the American Express (AmEx) project. The primary focus is on preparing datasets for predictive modeling and generating insights into cricket match outcomes.

## Overview

The main file in this repository is `Amex_match_prediction.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook that guides through various steps of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and analysis.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - **Data Sources**: The notebook loads several CSV files containing various data points such as match details (`train_data`, `test_data`), batsman statistics (`batsman_level_scorecard`), bowler statistics (`bowler_level_scorecard`), match-level statistics (`match_level_scorecard`), and additional round 2 data (`round2_data`).
   - **Data Loading Code Snippet**:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Load datasets
     df_train = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AmEx/663e2b6d54457_train_data_with_samplefeatures.csv")
     test_data = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AmEx/6644a1e287df6_test_data_with_samplefeatures.csv")
     batsman_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AmEx/663e2b548c98c_batsman_level_scorecard.csv")
     bowler_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AmEx/663e2b2c60743_bowler_level_scorecard.csv")
     match_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AmEx/664389efa0868_match_level_scorecard.csv")
     round2_data = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AmEx/667a986f0b981_r2_data_with_samplefeatures.csv")
     ```

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Functionality**: Various preprocessing steps are implemented, including handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
   - **Data Preprocessing Code Snippet**:
     ```python
     def preprocess_batsman(batsman_df):
         # Handling missing values and data type conversion
         # ...
         return batsman_df

     batsman_df = preprocess_batsman(batsman_df)
     ```

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Feature Creation**: Functions for creating new features based on cricket match data, such as calculating win probabilities based on venue and toss decisions.
   - **Feature Engineering Code Snippet**:
     ```python
     def calculate_team1_win_chances(row):
         if (row['toss winner'] == 1 and row['toss decision'] == 1) or (row['toss winner'] == 0 and row['toss decision'] == 0):
             return row['venue_based_bat_first_win_probability']
         else:
             return 1.0 - row['venue_based_bat_first_win_probability']

     df_train['team1_win_chance'] = df_train.apply(calculate_team1_win_chances, axis=1)
     ```

4. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - **Visualizing Insights**: Utilizes Matplotlib for visualizing win percentages against specific match features, providing insights into team performance and match outcomes.
   - **Visualization Code Snippet**:
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     def plot_win_percentage_vs_feature(df, feature_name, target_name='winner', bins=20):
         # Plotting win percentage against a specific feature
         # ...
         plt.show()

     plot_win_percentage_vs_feature(df_train, 'Overall_performance_relative_VenueVise')
     ```

## Usage

To utilize the scripts and notebooks:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shubham246763/YourRepo.git
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Navigate to the cloned repository and open `Amex_match_prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

3. **Execute the Notebook**: Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute code cells step-by-step. Modify parameters, add additional analysis, or customize functions according to your project requirements.

4. **Explore and Analyze**: Explore the processed datasets, visualizations, and insights generated from the feature engineering steps. Use these insights for further predictive modeling or analytical tasks related to cricket match prediction.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure Python and necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `tqdm`) are installed in your environment.
- Customize functions and parameters as per specific data requirements or modeling objectives.
